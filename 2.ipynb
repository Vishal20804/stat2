    "Mean: The mean is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and dividing the sum by the total number of values. It represents the average value of the dataset and is affected by extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by extreme values compared to the mean.\n",

    "Mode: The mode is the value or values that occur most frequently in a dataset. In other words, it is the value(s) with the highest frequency. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more than two modes (multimodal). Unlike the mean and median, the mode can be applied to both numerical and categorical data.\n"
